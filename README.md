Dog park webapp aimed to connect pet owners in dog parks.

##  Stack
### Frontend:
- React
- React-Hooks for state management (or Redux)
- React-Router (Helps building web as a Single Page Application)
- CSS (and maybe Sass)

### Backend:
- Ruby
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize as our ORM?

### Complementary tools:
- Webpack
- Try Typescript?
- Jest-Enzyme (unit tests, mocks, snapshots, TDD)
- DevOps -> go with create-react-app

### To do list:
1) Sketch the web
2) Complete backlog
3) Analyze DB model
4) Try Gatsby? (for what I've read, this tool works best for statis websites, and in our case it would be a completely dynamic website)
5) Go mobile first
